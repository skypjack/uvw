* Make all tests pass on all platforms
* Review fs_event, maybe we can make it work without creating N specializations? All fs_*_callback(s) would go as well
* Pass the events to the emitter, avoid allocations for the map and the handlers (use an std::tuple<handler<T>...>)
* Reduce compile-time, use clang ftime and whatnot
* add iwyu and clean up everything
* Allocator support
